## 📦 Repository Version

- **Version**: 1.0.0  
- **Release Date**: June 06, 2025  
- **Changelog**: Initial release

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `exp_data/` — Experimental dataset (`exp_data.csv`) and [README](exp_data/README.md) with column descriptions.
- `fds_input_file/` — FDS input file replicating the convective ignition experiment.
- `results/` — Output figures and data generated by analysis and modeling notebooks.
- `ignition.ipynb` — Notebook analyzing time to ignition, ignition probability, and glowing-to-flaming transitions.
- `thermal-model.ipynb` — Notebook implementing the thermal ignition model of a pine needle.

---

### 1. Experimental Data ([exp_data/](exp_data/))

- Contains the dataset `exp_data.csv` with ignition delay, FMC, thermocouple data, flame measurements, among others.
- A local [README file](exp_data/README.md) describes each column, units, and relevant notes.


---

### 2. Ignition Analysis ([`ignition.ipynb`](ignition.ipynb))

- Time-to-ignition measurements for Douglas fir samples under hot convective flow.
- Includes statistical analysis of ignition probability as a function of gas temperature and fuel moisture content (FMC).
- Contains logistic regression to identify the critical gas temperature ($T_{gas,cr}$) for 50% ignition probability.
- Evaluates the duration between glowing combustion and flaming ignition ($\Delta t = t_{ig} - t_{glow}$).



---

### 3. Thermally controlled ignition model ([`thermal-model.ipynb`](thermal-model.ipynb))

- Implements a 0D transient energy balance on a pine needle (cylindrical element) under convective flow.
- Includes convective heating, radiative input from plenum walls, and radiative losses.
- Uses experimentally derived parameters (e.g., gas temperature, flow velocity, surface area).
- Predicts ignition delay time for a critical solid temperature ($T_{s,cr}$).
- Results are compared with experimental measurements for validation.

---

### 4. Numerical Simulation (FDS) ([📁 `fds_input_file/`](fds_input_file/))

- Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) setup replicating the convective ignition apparatus.
- Includes mesh layout, inflow conditions, Lagrangian fuel particles, and ignition criteria.
- A simplified spark model is used to trigger gas-phase ignition based on solid temperature.
- Simulation is validated against experimental observations (ignition delay time).

**See full details in** [`fds_input_file/README.md`](fds_input_file/README.md)

---

### 5. Results ([results/](results/))

- Stores figures and postprocessed data generated from `ignition.ipynb` and `thermal-model.ipynb`.
